# Bed leveling issues

## Unlevels between prints, or while printing

The bed would become unlevel after nearly every print, or while printing. The bed leveling knobs were not turning while printing.

### Solution

The bed level screws were detached from the rubber insulator between the metal bed and the removable bed plate (magnetic or glass). Adding lock nuts to the screws fixed the issue.
