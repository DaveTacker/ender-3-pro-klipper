# My Ender 3-Pro klipper and octoprint setup

This is the latest operating configuration for my [Creality Ender 3 Pro 220x220x250MM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K3SZBHJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) purchased Dec 11, 2020.

The idea behind this repo is to document the steps I took to get my printer up and running with [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/). I ran into many issues unrelated to klipper and octoprint, so I wanted to document the steps I took to get everything working.

## Vendor Documentation

Within the [./docs](./docs/) directory you will find vendor documentation for the BigTreeTech SKR Mini v3, Creality v4.2.2, and Creality Sprite Extruder. 

## Klipper Configuration

The [printer.cfg](./printer.cfg) file is the configuration file for the printer. This file is used by the klipper software to control the printer.

## Issues and Solutions

I ran into many issues while setting up my printer. I have documented the issues and solutions in the [issues](./issues/) directory.
